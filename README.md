### About Me
Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I like to organize all my chaotic ideas into one chamber called a repository.
- I am currently powering through react and picking up new technologies like Typescript and tailwind.
-  I am also a sophomore-year student Bachelor's in information technology. 
- When not making commits, I listen to podcasts like the [Naval podcast](https://nav.al/) and The late night linux podcast.
- My tech toolbox is ever growing but it currently includes
 ```js
let mtende={
    langs:[Java,C++,Javascript, Typescript,Html,css],
     Frameworks:[ React, Tailwind],
     OperatingSystem:[Linux,windows-subsytem-linux,windows],
      Design:[Adobe photoshop, Figma]
}
