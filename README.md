### About Me
Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I like to organize all my chaotic ideas into one chamber called a repository.
- I am currently powering through React and picking up new technologies like Typescript and tailwind.
-  I am also a sophomore-year student, Bachelor's in information technology. 
- When not making commits, I listen to podcasts like the [Naval podcast](https://nav.al/) and The late night linux podcast.
- I am very intrested in LLMs and firmly believe self-hosted AI is the future.
   > I am currently running gemma2:2b locally. And I plan to blog about my experience in the near future :)
- My tech toolbox is ever growing but it currently includes

 ```js
let mtende={
    langs:[Java,C++,Javascript, Typescript,Html,css],
     Frameworks:[ React, Tailwind],
     OperatingSystem:[Linux, windows-subsytem-linux, windows],
      Design:[Adobe-photoshop, Figma]
}
```
