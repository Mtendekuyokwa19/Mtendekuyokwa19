### About Me

*I am currently in school, pushing through a Bachelors degree in Information technology. I have picked up React so expect new projects pretty soon :)* 
*I spend my free time listening to the naval podcast or late linux podcast. I read philosophy at times. I also love swimiming through hacker news for innovations and updates*
